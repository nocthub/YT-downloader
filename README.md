🎥 YT Downloader Web ApplicationThis repository contains the source code for a full-stack web application designed to download YouTube content (video and audio) via a user-friendly interface. The application is built with a decoupled architecture, using Python/Flask for the backend and Python/Streamlit for the frontend, all orchestrated via Docker Compose.The use of Docker Compose makes deployment straightforward and ensures the application runs consistently across different environments.📁 Project StructureThe project is structured into three main components:BACKEND/: Contains the Python Flask application (api.py) responsible for handling download requests, processing content with yt-dlp, and managing download status.FRONTEND/: Contains the Python Streamlit application (app.py) which provides the web interface, communicates with the backend, and displays real-time download progress.docker-compose.yml: Defines the services (frontend and backend), their network connectivity, and the shared volume for downloads.🚀 Getting Started (Using Docker Compose)The easiest way to run this application is by using Docker Compose, as the services are configured to communicate with each other internally.PrerequisitesYou must have the following software installed on your system:**** Docker: Follow the official Docker documentation for installation on your OS.Docker Compose: This is typically bundled with modern Docker installations.1. Build and Run the ContainersNavigate to the root directory of your project (where docker-compose.yml is located) and execute the following command:docker-compose up --build -d
up: Starts the services defined in the docker-compose.yml.--build: Forces Docker to re-build the images from their Dockerfiles, ensuring you have the latest code.-d: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).2. Access the ApplicationOnce the containers are running (it may take a minute for Streamlit to start):Frontend (UI): Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501Backend (API): The API is running internally on port 5000 but is not directly exposed for external use, ensuring security.3. Stop and Clean UpTo stop the running containers and remove the created network:docker-compose down
To stop the containers and remove the persistent volumes (including all downloaded files):docker-compose down -v
🛠️ Local Development (Without Docker)If you wish to run the frontend or backend separately for development, you must manage their environments and connectivity manually.Backend (BACKEND/api.py)Navigate to the BACKEND directory: cd BACKENDInstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (assuming a requirements.txt exists listing flask, yt-dlp, flask-cors).Run the Flask API: python api.pyNote: You may need to change the DOWNLOAD_FOLDER path in api.py to a local path (e.g., ./downloads) if you are not using the Docker volume.Frontend (FRONTEND/app.py)Navigate to the FRONTEND directory: cd FRONTENDInstall dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt (assuming a requirements.txt exists listing streamlit, requests).Crucially, update the BACKEND_URL in app.py from the Docker network address (http://yt-backend:5000) to your local machine address (http://localhost:5000).Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py🤝 ContributionFeel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
