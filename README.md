A robust, full-stack web application for downloading YouTube content as high-quality **Video (MP4)** or **Audio (MP3)**.

This project leverages the power of **yt-dlp** within an asynchronous backend (Flask) and provides a real-time, interactive user interface (Streamlit). The entire system is containerized for easy deployment.

## ✨ Features

- **🎥 Dual Mode**: Choose between downloading high-resolution Video (`.mp4`) or extracting Audio (`.mp3`).
- **⚡ Asynchronous Processing**: Downloads run in the background via a dedicated Flask API, ensuring the UI remains responsive.
- **📊 Real-Time Status**: Monitor download progress with dynamic updates and speed indicators.
- **📂 File Management**: Access, stream, download, and delete media files directly from the integrated library.
- **🐳 Dockerized**: Built for instant deployment using Docker Compose.
